        <h2>The assamese style pork curry</h2>

    <p>When famous author Charles Dickens (Great Expectations) had said, “if you want a subject, look at pork”, little had anyone fathom the depth of the statement. Dickens had in that one sentence not only paid ode to one of the world’s richest source of nourishment that was outrageously cheap, but also anchored one of the most profound observation on how ancient cultures developed.</p>
    <p>Much to the commonness of today, adds Geeta, “pork for a good part of the Assam history was a privy of the much colder Upper Assam, where it wasn’t just considered a fine source of nourishment but also an ingredient that was available through the year. Such was the reverence of this single natural flavourant that Gahori – Assamese for Pork – was part of many rituals. In fact, the gift of pork meat (fresh that is) was considered one of the finest during the Ahom dynasty – and a meal that had more than one pork dish, a celebratory feast.”</p>
